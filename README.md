# card10-engelsystem
Display your shifts directly on your card10.

Simply install this app and download your shifts as JSON from the engelsystem (in your account page).
Put the json into a file called `shifts.json` and start the app.
For camp 2019 you can find your shifts here https://engelsystem.camp.ccc.de/camp19/users?action=view

You can navigate trough your shifts using the left and right button.

Since the clock isn't working yet the shifts are simply displayed (last booked shift first). 
Alarms and fancy ordering are planned for future versions.
